# Build Backend With FastAPI - Virtual Candy Store

## Repo Setup

1. Fork the Repo, so that you can write your code in your own repo.
2. Clone the Repo to your local machine.
3. You need two terminals open, one for running the backend and the other for running the frontend.
4. `cd frontend` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5. `cd backend` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
6. Run frontend using `npm start` and backend using `fastapi dev main.py` in the respective terminals.
7. You can now start writing your code.
